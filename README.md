# -Single-Stage-Pipeline-Register-
This project implements a single-stage pipeline register using a standard valid/ready handshake protocol. The module buffers one data word between an upstream producer and a downstream consumer. Data is captured when both in_valid and in_ready are high, and the stored value is presented on the output with out_valid. The design correctly handles backpressure by preventing new data from overwriting stored data until the downstream side asserts out_ready. On reset, the pipeline register is cleared to an empty state. The design is fully synthesizable and ensures no data loss or duplication.
